# Introduction to Databases for Back-end Development

## Week 1

### Introduction to Databases

### Databases and Data

database
- collection of organize data stored and accessed electronically

types
- flat files DBs
- relational DBs
- noSQL DBs

tables
- provides clear view of data

primary key
- used as a unique identifier in tables

foreign key
- used to link a record in one table to a record in another table
- ie.
    - customer table contains customers
        - primary key custID
    - order table contains orders
        - must contain a field that indicates which customer made the order

#### Alternative types of databases

relational - structured

- NoSQL
    - flexible structure for storing/scaling data
    - can store different formats
    - used by IoT, social media
    - can be document DBs, graph DBs, key-value DBs

big data
- complex data that grows exponentially (like IoT)
- can be [un,semi]structured
- different sources

cloud DBs
- lack of infrastructure/maintenance/storage costs
- used for BI (business intelligence)
